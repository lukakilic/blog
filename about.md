I am Luka, I live in Germany. I created this tranquil place to document my thougths, ideas and the knowledge I gather throughout my journey. My interests sway from design and coding to ancient philosophy and cryptography. To get a better understanding of what I post about, simply take a look at the <a href="/tags">Tags</a>.
